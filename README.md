* Install `Hexalie Stream Utility.sef` to SAMMI by selecting `SAMMI Bridge > Install Extension`
* Copy the `Client` folder to wherever you'd like
* Add whatever overlays you'd like to the `Client/media` folder
* Add `Client/hsu-client.html` as a `Browser Source` in OBS
* Download `hst-server.exe` from https://github.com/tommadness/hst-server/releases
* Start `hst-server.exe`
  * I'd recommend adding a button to SAMMI to start `hst-server.exe` whenever the Bridge is loaded
